# Printing
This document describes various aspects of printing all the parts for the Jonstrup Inchworm. Look in the tables how 
many of each STL you need to print.

## PLA and NYLON
Most parts are printed in PLA. Three parts are printed in Taulman 618 nylon. Nylon is chosen either as a lubricant-free 
bushing on the z-axis or as the heat tolerant fan shroud on the E3D hotend. 

## Brims or Rafts
The large STL files have _manual brims_. The brims assures adhesion to the build plate.
