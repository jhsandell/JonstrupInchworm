# Jonstrup Inchworm 3D Printer

## This is the source repository for building a Jonstrup Inchworm 3d printer.
Here you will find all CAD and STL files, as well as description of the kinematics and illustrations.

Read about [the INCHWORM machine](/themachine.md).

The machine is basically a 2D delta printer for the XY plane, and the rails (*) "go in the wrong direction".
The z-axis is a regular cartesian rail. 

(*) There is only one rail.

## The Name
The effector arms and sliders may look like a Geometridae larvae (yeah, some wicked imagination required...)
If I have any spare time, I will implement a short feature to show the [Geometridae larvae locomotion]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncx4o-W9R2c). And to keep up with inventive printer names, I decided to 
name _my variant of the INCHWORM machine_ Jonstrup; a local town which is pronouncable in English without 
any tweaking.

## Development Only

__This design is still a development project.__
CAD files are subject to change without notice, as features and tweaks are implemented.

The firmware is in the [Marlin_Inchworm repository](https://github.com/jhsandell/MarlinDev_Inchworm)
